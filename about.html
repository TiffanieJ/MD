			<h2>Section title</h2>
			<p>After growing up in northern California and spending time in San Francisco, Sacramento and Southern California, Alisha made the decision to make Southern California home and to live in the big city - Los Angeles. She was inspired and influenced by the surrounding art and architecture to pursue a degree in Interior Design. </p>
			<p>In 2002-2004, while in college, she worked in the design field for a company focused on community planning and model home design. Here she learned the balance of materials and color in master planned communities and the art of putting together model homes. After college, she moved on to work in the high residential design market and worked with renowned Interior Designers. During this time Alisha worked on a variety of projects including historical home renovations and new constructions all within a variety of design styles. </p>
            <p>In 2014, she felt it was time to make her own mark on the design community and started Mora Design Inc. Mora Design focuses on each clientâ€™s different style, while putting together a design scheme and plans that fit their individual needs. Mora Design specializes in residential and commercial interior design, construction projects, designing remodels including kitchens and bathrooms. Mora Design is also very experienced in specifying interior paint colors, finishes and furniture design and layout. We enjoy being involved in construction and project management, working along side contractors to ensure all of the details of their clients remodels move along smoothly and no small detail is missed.</p>
			<p>Mora Design works in a variety of styles and budgets, shopping at design centers, showrooms and even local vendors to find the best fits for each clients home. When not working with clients, Alisha enjoys being with her family and dogs, exploring locals parks, museums and camping while still finding inspiration in her everyday life and adventures. </p>
